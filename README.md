### Customizing theme

[Ant Design](https://ant.design) is using Less for styling.
[A set of less variables](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design/blob/master/components/style/themes/default.less)
are defined for each design aspect that can be customized.
This variables can be override by defining values in `less-overrides.js` file.
